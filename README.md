# Community Balance Mod-Small
A Natural Selection 2 balance and feature mod developed and maintained by the Community developers.
Designed for smaller teams for example 6vs6 in competetive plays.
This mod is based on the BDT Community Balance Mod: https://github.com/ns2-bdt/CommunityBalanceMod

## Building
To build the mod run the create_build.sh script in the project root.

```bash
./create_build.sh [build_target] [build_type]
```

e.g.
```bash
./create_build.sh dev launchpad
```

There are currently two types of builds:
 - launchpad: to be used with the Launchpad utility
 - steamcmd: to be used with steamcmd (or publish.sh)

## Publishing
To publish the mod on the workshop first [build](#building) the mod, then depending on the build you can either run Launchpad or steamcmd.

### Launchpad
To publish the mod with Launchpad open the build directory with Launchpad and click publish

### Steamcmd
To publish the mod with Steamcmd run the ./publish.sh script

## Large File Storage (LFS)
To deal with the sound files (>100 Mbs), we must use LFS. To install LFS use the following commands:
1. sudo apt-get install git-lfs
2. git lfs install

To select files to ignore:
1. git lfs track "FILE EXTENSION (.txt, .fsb, etc.)" -- Ex. git lfs track "*.fsb"
2. git add "FILE PATH" -- Ex. git add /mnt/d/Github/CommunityBalanceMod/src/sound/eem.bank00.fsb

Commit with the chosen files to ignore:
1. git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
